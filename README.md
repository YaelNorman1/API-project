# API-project- U_code

API-project-U_code is a project I created during U_code bootcamp in CyberArk. 
I created a Random-User-Page-Generator. It's like facebook profile page, filled with content taken from APIs and generated with different data at the click of a button.
Using APIs, jQuery, Handlebars, Promises, TypeScript, and OOP.

TODO -
  - saving each RUPG page in DB
  - uploding all the saved pages
